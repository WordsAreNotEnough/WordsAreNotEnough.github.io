My eyes are open, but I am looking at nothing. I stare at nothing for a long time. Sometimes tears move behind my eyes, feel for an exit. But they are like groundhogs too old to dig through. 

Goldie must be where I left everything. When she came, she brought everything along with her. When she left, I gave it all back without meaning to. I have no artifact of her. Memories are not artifacts. When you are shot, the bullet is hot from combustion and friction but it quickly reaches equilibrium with your flesh. She is in the ground. 
When I imagined moving here, sometimes I imagined a woman with me but mostly I did not. But I always imagined Goldie would be here, even before I knew her. And then she was here. And she is not anymore. 

She knew that I was pretending, because I told her. Chopping wood for fires, repairing the house – I am as incompetent as a child. I could tell she knew more than me but was happy to play along. I thought I would get smarter, but I have gotten stupider. I should make a shrine to remember. Especially as I have gotten stupider, memories are nothing like artifacts. A shrine is an artifact.

I thought there were barriers between things. Even if you swallow something, there is a barrier. On the other hand: if you are really ignorant of something, it doesn’t exist. Goldie was more aware than anyone that I was pretending; she was ignorant, maybe, of barriers. 

It is impossible to be present all the time. There is too much.

I was digging for a long time. After a while, I forgot what I was digging for and maybe I dug for too long. It was dark and I was seeing the dirt with my fingers. I sniffed the dirt but my sniffer is not adept like hers was. She was an expert – I am a novice. Dirt stuck to my face which was wet from crying, but I was not present for the part when I was crying. It is hard to be present for the whole thing, especially as I have gotten stupider. Stupidity sounds lovely, but it is not. When you’re stupid you get overwhelmed, and when you’re overwhelmed you can’t be there for the part where you’re crying because she is dead. 

No one told me I had to dig. I just knew. I knew there wasn’t anything to worry about. I want to go out there and dig again in the same spot, because maybe it will smell like her. A smell is much better than a memory. It is even better than an artifact. But my sniffer isn’t strong like hers. 

I am lying on the hard floor now and my throat hurts because maybe I was crying again.
